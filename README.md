# Helper Functions

## getHttpsCredentials() ###

**Returns** An object containing the HTTPS credentials to pass to https.createServer when offering an https server. These are read form /run/secrets/DATABOX.pem and are generated by the container-manger at run time.

## NewDataSourceMetadata ()

**Returns** An empty DataSourceMetadata object

DataSourceMetadata objects are used to describe your data source when creating a new one. They look like this:

```JS
    {
        Description:    "", // Text Description of you dataSource
        ContentType:    "", // The format the data is written in
                            // JSON,BINARY or TEXT.
        Vendor:         "", // Your company name.
        DataSourceType: "", // A short type string that represents your data
                            // it is used by apps to find the data you offer.
        DataSourceID:   "", // the ID of this data source, as the crater you
                            // are responsible for ensuring this is unique
                            // within your datastore.
        StoreType:      "", // The type of store this uses
                            // (probably store-core)
        IsActuator:  false, // is this an IsActuator?
        Unit:           "", // Text representation of the units
