# Node Databox


A Nodejs library used by databox apps and drivers to interfac with Databox APIs.

## Installation

To use this library in your node project, run:

    npm install --save node-databox

and then within your project:

    const databox = require('node-databox');

# Usage


> :warning: While this library is at [1.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) the API may change.

Examples of usage are provided in the https://github.com/me-box/databox-quickstart repository.


## Helper Functions

These functions are useful for parsing the configuration data passed to your app or driver.

### GetHttpsCredentials()

**Returns** An object containing the HTTPS credentials to pass to https.createServer when offering an https server. These are read from /run/secrets/DATABOX.pem and are generated by the container-manager at run time. This is useful for apps and driver offering interfaces over https.

### NewDataSourceMetadata ()

**Returns** An empty DataSourceMetadata object

DataSourceMetadata objects are used to describe your data source when creating a new one. They look like this:

```JS
    {
        Description:    "", // Text Description of your dataSource
        ContentType:    "", // The format the data is written in
                            // JSON,BINARY or TEXT.
        Vendor:         "", // Your company name.
        DataSourceType: "", // A short type string that represents your data
                            // it is used by apps to find the data you offer.
        DataSourceID:   "", // the ID of this data source, as the creator you
                            // are responsible for ensuring this is unique
                            // within your data store.
        StoreType:      "", // The type of store this uses
                            // (ts,ts/blob or kv)
        IsActuator:  false, // is this an IsActuator? it true other apps can
                            // request write access to this datasource
        Unit:           "", // Text representation of the units
        Location:       "", // Text representation of location Information
    };
```

## Using the databox core-store

The databox core-store supports the reading, writing, querying of time series and key value data. It is the default store for Databox version 0.3.0 and greater.

The time series API has support for writing generic JSON blobs (see TSBlob) or data in a specific format (see TS) which allows extra functionality such as joining, filtering and aggregation on the data. The key value API stores data against keys (see KV). All three type of data can be accessed through the databox.StoreClient.

| _enableLogging_ | `Bool` | Turns on verbose debug output |

**Returns** a new StoreClient that is connected to the provided store.

**example**
To create a new client to access a store:
```js
   const databox = require('node-databox');
   let client = databox.NewStoreClient(STORE_URI, ARBITER_URI, false)
```

### databox.StoreClient.RegisterDatasource (DataSourceMetadata)

This function registers your data sources with your store. Registering your data source makes them available to other databox apps.

## storeClient.TS

These functions allow you to manage structured json data in the time series store and allow for filtering and aggregation of the data.

Data written into a TimeSeriesStore must contain, A value (integer or floating point number) and a tag is an identifier with corresponding string value. For example:{"room": "lounge", "value": 1}. Tagging a value provides a way to group values together when accessing them. In the example provided you could retrieve all values that are in a room called 'lounge'.

Data returned from a query is a JSON dictionary containing a timestamp in epoch milliseconds and the actual data. For example:{"timestamp":1513160985841,"data":{"foo":"bar","value":1}}. Data can also be aggregated by applying functions across values. Aggregation functions result in a response of a single value. For example: {"result":1}.

The storeClient.TS supports the following functions:
