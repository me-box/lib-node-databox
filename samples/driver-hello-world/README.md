# driver-hello-world

A helloworld driver for databox


# To use 

Clone the git repo into the databox root directory 

     git clone https://github.com/me-box/lib-node-databox.git

Add the below to the end of docker-compose-dev-local-images.yaml (White space is important)

     driver-hello-world:
         build:
             context: ./lib-node-databox/samples/driver-hello-world
             dockerfile: Dockerfile${DATABOX_ARCH}
         image: driver-hello-world
         
 Then run on terminal.
 
 ./databox-start dev 
      
This will build all the local databox images and set up the local app store.

Next step is to open the local manifest server in a web brower by pointing this address http://127.0.0.1:8181 and upload app-manifest /lib-node-databox/samples/driver-hello-world/databox-manifest.json. Once manifest is uploaded, close the the local manifest server by closing the browser.

If you point browser to databox user interface https://127.0.0.1:8989, you can see app-hello-world in the registered drivers tabs. Now using databox user interface you can install  the driver by clicking on the install button.
